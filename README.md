# IAS_Project
My project for the IAS lecture - Augmented Toys

Everthing important is in the folder Assets.

There are: 
-the C# scripts I used under Scripts
-the Imagetargets I used under Imagetargets
-the 3DToys and the used Buttons in ImportedAssets
-the made scenes including the finaldraft.scene (= my final Prototype) in Scenes
